<p>This is the second part of a 2 part series giving a simple technical overview of the V8 Javascript engine.</p>

<p>In the <a href="blog/2012/01/07/exploring-the-v8-js-engine-part-1/">first part</a> of this series I showed you how simple it is to get started with the V8 Javascript engine.</p>
<p>In this second part we'll look into sharing objects and variables in a V8 program, as well as digging into the source of the popular (on V8 based) <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>, to see how variable/object sharing is implemented in a real world example.</p>

<p>In V8 there are 2 types shared variables:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Variables where you can change the value</li>
  <li>Variables with an unchangeable value</li>
</ul>

<p class="warning"><b>Warning</b>: You are able to change the value of and unchangeable variable, but it will only be reflected in the Javascript (not the C++).</p>

<p>For variables with an unchangeable value you only have to set the value.</p>
<p>This is a bit trickier with shared variables that are changeable, for those you need "Getter" & "Setter" functions, that get called when the variable is accessed.</p>
<p>I will cover both of those types below and then show them implemented in the Node.js source.</p>

<h2>Variables with an unchangeable value</h2>

<p>Based off our <a href="/blog/2012/01/07/exploring-the-v8-js-engine-part-1/#gist-1574928">previous example (part 1 of this series)</a>, sharing an unchangeable variable is pretty simple. All you have to do is use the <code>Set(...)</code> function to set the variable's value.</p>

<p>This program will create the variable <code>pid</code> in the Javascript's context:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;v8.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
// Include the header that contains the "getpid()" function

using namespace v8;

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {

  // Create a stack-allocated handle scope.
  HandleScope handle_scope;

  Handle&lt;ObjectTemplate&gt; global_templ = ObjectTemplate::New();
  global_templ->Set(String::New("pid"), Integer::New(getpid()));

  // Create a new context.
  Persistent&lt;Context&gt; context = Context::New(NULL, global_templ);

  // Enter the created context for compiling and
  // running the hello world script.
  context->Enter();

  // Create a string containing the JavaScript source code.
  Handle&lt;String&gt; source = String::New("pid;");

  // Compile the source code.
  Handle&lt;Script&gt; script = Script::Compile(source);

  // Run the script to get the result.
  Handle&lt;Value&gt; result = script->Run();

  // Dispose the persistent context.
  context.Dispose();

  // Convert the result to an ASCII string and print it.
  String::AsciiValue ascii(result);
  printf("%s\n", *ascii);
  return 0;
  }
</code></pre>

<p>If you save it in a file called <code>variable_share_unchangeable.cc</code> (in <code>~/dev/v8/</code>) you can compile and run it with:</p>
<pre><code>$ g++ -m32 -Iinclude libv8.a -lpthread variable_share_unchangeable.cc \
  -o variable_share_unchangeable
</code></pre>
<p><em>For more information on running and compiling see <a href="http://jcla1.com/blog/2012/01/07/exploring-the-v8-js-engine-part-1/">the first post</a></em></p>

<p>When this program is run it will print out its own <code>pid</code>. The interesting thing about that is now though, that the <code>pid</code> is accessed by the Javascript not the C++.</p>

<h2>Variables with a changeable value</h2>

<p>Defining variables that a C++ and Javascript program share, where you are able to change the value are a bit trickier.</p>
<p>As I said before, you need to define a "Getter" and "Setter" for each variable you want to share.
Here is a program that demonstrates the use of shared changeable variables:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;v8.h&gt;

using namespace v8;

// This is the variable we are going to share
int x = 15;

// Gets called when the value of x is requested
Handle&lt;Value&gt; XGetter(Local&lt;String&gt; property, const AccessorInfo& info) {
  // Create a new Javascript int from the
  // current value of "x"
  return Integer::New(x);
}

// Gets called when "x" is set to a new value
void XSetter(Local&lt;String&gt; property, Local&lt;Value&gt; value, const AccessorInfo& info) {
  // Change the value of the "x" in the C++
  // to a 32-Bit representation of the value passed
  x = value->Int32Value();
}

void CompileAndPrint(const Handle&lt;String&gt; source) {
  // Compile the source code.
  Handle&lt;Script&gt; script = Script::Compile(source);

  // Run the script to get the result.
  Handle&lt;Value&gt; result = script->Run();

  // Convert the result to an ASCII string and print it.
  String::AsciiValue ascii(result);
  printf("%s\n", *ascii);
}

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {

  // Create a stack-allocated handle scope.
  HandleScope handle_scope;

  // Create a new ObjectTemplate
  Handle&lt;ObjectTemplate> global_templ = ObjectTemplate::New();

  // Set the XGetter and XSetter function
  // to be called when the value of "x" is requested
  // or "x" is set to a different value.
  global_templ->SetAccessor(String::New("x"), XGetter, XSetter);

  // Create a new context.
  Persistent&lt;Context&gt; context = Context::New(NULL, global_templ);

  // Enter the created context for compiling and
  // running the hello world script.
  context->Enter();

  // x is still equal to 15 here
  Handle&lt;String&gt; s1 = String::New("x;");
  CompileAndPrint(s1);

  // Here we change x to 250
  Handle&lt;String>&gt;s2 = String::New("x = 250;");
  CompileAndPrint(s2);

  // We print out x in C++ to see if the value has changed
  printf("%d\n", x);

  // Dispose the persistent context.
  context.Dispose();

  return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>It seems a lot of code for just one variable, though as you will see in the Node.js source, once you use multiple variables you will hardly notice the surroundings.</p>

<h2>Node.js source</h2>

<p>Here we'll dig into where and how Node.js uses these shared variables.</p>
<p>Specifically I will use the process object as an example.</p>
<p>It is not necessary that you fully understand how the internals of Node.js work, all you need to know is that there is a <code><a href="https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/src/node.cc#L3087-3140">Start</a></code> function right at the end of <a href="https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/src/node.cc">this file</a>, that calls another function, which then calls another function that sets up the process object. The name of this function is <code><a href="https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/src/node.cc#L2301-2484">SetupProcessObject</a></code>.</p>
<p>This function sets up, among others, the <code>pid</code> variable that we had as an example. In the case of Node.js, this variable is unchangeable.</p>
<p>An example of a changeable variable in Node.js is the <code>process.title</code>, it is the name or the title of the current program.</p>
<p>Try it out by doing:</p>

<pre><code>$ node
> process.title = "this_is_a_test";
'this_is_a_test'
</code></pre>
<p>You won't notice a difference in node but if you look up the process name of node in Activity Monitor or Task Manager, etc. it will be "this_is_a_test" (without quotes):</p>

<p>That was a short overview of shared variables in the V8 Javascript engine.</p>
<p>I didn't cover shared functions, because the post was that long already, but if you would like me to write a blog post about them too, just <a href="mailto:whitegolem@gmail.com">email me at whitegolem@gmail.com</a>.</p>
