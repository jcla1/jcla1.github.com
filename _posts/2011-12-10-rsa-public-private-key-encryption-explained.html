<p>In this blog post I'll show you how to calculate a simple RSA private-/public-key pair.</p>

<p>First of all you need to know that each key (the public-key and the private-key) consists of 2 parts. The first part is different in each key, the second is equal in both. So let's start calculating!</p>

<p class="warning"><b>Warning:</b>  The encryption in this tutorial has a very low security level, because of the low values of <code>p</code> and <code>q</code>! To improve the security level choose higher primes.</p>

<ol>
    <li>
      <p>Think of 2 prime numbers.</p>

      <p>In real openssl, these prime numbers are very large and have a similar bit-size. So that we have no problem doing the calculations I'll choose 2 numbers that are quite small:</p>
      <pre><code>
p = 3, q = 11
      </code></pre>

    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Calculate the modulus for the public/private key.</p>

      <p>This is the number that is the same in both keys, let's call it <code>n</code>. It is used as the modulus in en- and decryption. You calculate it by doing: <pre><code>n = 3*11</code></pre></p>
    </li>

  <li>
    <p>Calculate the totient of n.</p>

    <p>Calculating the totient is easy. You could use a table and look up the value, but the calculation is just as easy and faster.
    Just do:</p>
    <pre><code>totient(n) = (p - 1) * (q - 1)</code></pre>
    <p>In our case we do:</p>
    <pre><code>totient(33) = (3 - 1) * (11 - 1)</code></pre>
    <p>This equals <code>20</code>.</p>

    So far we have:
<pre><code>
p = 3
q = 11
n = 33
totient(n) = 20
</code></pre>

  <li>
    <p>Choose a number for <code>e</code></p>

    <p>This number is is a bit harder than the others. It has to be between <code>1</code> and <code>n</code>,
    also coprime to <code>n</code>.</p>
    <p>This basically means that the greatest common divisor of both numbers is <code>1</code>.
    If you choose a prime number for <code>e</code> all you need to do now is check that <code>e</code> isn't a divisor of
    <code>n</code>. I'll choose the number: <pre><code>e = 17</code></pre></p>
  </li>


  <li>
    <p>Calculating the modular multiplicative inverse of <code>e * (mod totient(n))</code></p>

    <p>Now at first this sounds a bit overwhelming, I struggled a bit to find out what it means. Expressed in an easy way you could say: <q>What is the solution to the equation:</q></p>
    <pre><code>(e * x - 1) mod (totient(n)) = 0</code></pre>
    It would take quite long to work it out by hand so I wrote a small Javascript function that does the work for me:

<pre><code>
function doLoop(e, totient) {
  var i = 1, x;
  while (true) {
    x = (e * i - 1) % totient;
    if (x === 0) {
      console.log(i);
      break;
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

    <p>The function takes 2 arguments, one is <code>e</code> the other is the <code>totient(n)</code>. Depending on your processor and the size of the numbers you choose it can take longer or shorter to run.</p>
    <p>In our case the function will log the value <code>13</code>, which I'll call <code>d</code>. Now you have all the values needed for public-/private-key encryption and decryption.</p>

  <li>
    <p>Putting it all together</p>

    <p>All the values up to now:</p>
<pre><code>
p = 3
q = 11
n = 33
totient(n) = 20
e = 17
d = 13
</code></pre>

    <p>Your public-key is now: <code>e = 17, n = 33</code></p>
    <p>Your private-key is now: <code>d = 13, n = 33</code></p>

    <p>With this private and public-key you can now encrypt data by doing this:</p>

    <p>We'll encrypt the value:</p>
    <pre><code>m = 9</code></pre>

    <p>To encrypt with the public key, you take m to the power of e (in the public-key) mod n</p>
    <pre><code>m ^ e mod n</code></pre>
    <pre><code>9 ^ 17 mod 33 = 15</code></pre>

    <p>Our encrypted value is:</p>
    <pre><code>c = 15</code></pre>

    <p>This can only be decrypted with the private-key.</p>
    <p>To decrypt it, you take c to the power of d (in the private-key) mod n</p>
    <pre><code>c ^ d mod n</code></pre>
    <pre><code>15 ^ 13 mod 33 = 9</code></pre>

    <p>Now we have our original value!</p>
  </li>
</ul>
