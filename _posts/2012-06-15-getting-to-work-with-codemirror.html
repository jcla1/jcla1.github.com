<p>Recently on <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/">Hackernews</a> I found an interesting link. It pointed to <a href="http://rubyfiddle.com/">RubyFiddle</a>. The site is really nice, but my favourite bit was the editor.</p>
<p>By then I had already guessed they hadn't done it themselves so I <em>investigated</em> (looked in the source..) and found they're using <a href="http://codemirror.net/">CodeMirror</a>.
I had heared about CodeMirror before but I never really liked online IDEs. But this editor <strong>really</strong> caught my eye so I decided to try the most basic setup.</p>
<p>Turns out, it's really simple! It's just 1, in words one, line of Javascript! (Plus basic HTML)</p>

<pre><code>
CodeMirror(document.getElementById('container'));
</code></pre>

<p>That is all that is needed. Thanks to Marijn Haverbeke for such a great online editor.</p>

<p>Below is a demo of it:</p>
