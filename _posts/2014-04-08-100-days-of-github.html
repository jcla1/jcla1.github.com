<p>In recent times <a href="https://ryanseys.com/blog/177-days-of-github/">there's been</a> <a href="http://natashatherobot.com/streak-github-mistakes/">a trend</a> <a href="http://danwin.com/2013/12/github-activity-for-2013-1500-commits-52-day-streak/">coming up</a>, of having <i>long</i> commit streaks on Github. Be it for fun, <a href="http://dontbreakthechain.com/">motivational purposes</a> or just out of boredom. In any case, I decided to also hop onto the train and try it for myself. In the following, I'd like to share my experience with you as to what helped survive my first 100 days of Github.</p>

<h2>An open source project</h2>
<p>Github is a platform for open source projects, so it will obviously be a great help to either contribute regularly or even maintain an open source project, or multiple. This has saved me a few times during my streak, because as Ryan Seys already noticed in his <a href="https://ryanseys.com/blog/177-days-of-github/">blog post</a> about commit streaks:</p>
<blockquote>Pull requests count for 1 contribution when you make them and another contribution if they are merged. If they donâ€™t get merged, sorry, no second contribution.</blockquote>
<p>So no need directly send a PR when you push, you can take your time knowing that your PR will also count as a contribution. Plus if you get promoted to contributer status in a repository, your merge commits (of other PRs) also count as contributions.</p>
<p>In my case, I contributed to a <a href="https://github.com/kennyledet/Algorithm-Implementations">repository of algorithms</a>, which you should go check out (pun definitely intended) and contribute to. This repository also has the nice effect that there's a near infinite amount of algorithms to implement (combined with a vast amount of different languages), so you won't run out of things to implement and might even learn a new language.</a>

<h2>A blog</h2>

<p>Blogs are the medium of developers, they communicate via them and share their thoughts and ideas through them. So there is no reason why blogs (specifically your blog) should be excluded from your achievements as a developer, your commit streak.</p>
<p>Be it writing posts or just drafting them, adding <a href="https://schema.org/BlogPosting">microdata markup</a> (which is what I did) or completely redesigning them, you will definitely profit from maintaining a blog as a developer and so will your commit streak. As you see a blog is key, not just for your commit streak, but for your existence as a developer.</p>

<h2>Programmer's challenges</h2>
<p>This is a topic for another post, but what I recommend you to do is: Keep a list of interesting challenges to solve, they needn't be programming related, but most of them will (hopefully) be. To get you started on your list I can highly recommend Jason Rudolph's <a href="http://jasonrudolph.com/blog/2011/08/09/programming-achievements-how-to-level-up-as-a-developer/">Programming Achievements</a>, Matt Might's <a href="http://matt.might.net/#teaching">course work assignments</a> (especially the <a href="https://github.com/mattmight/utah-sldi-sp2014-p1/blob/18e2393bfe13827c33b152b69340cad8bbb1d376/README.md">scripting language assignments</a>) and of course the exercises from SICP. Of course, for this to be beneficial to your commit streak it needs to be in a Github repository, so no solving Project Euler problems ;-) !</p>

<h2>Final thoughts</h2>
<p>Beyond all this, the most important thing is you, well not <i>really</i>, it's your ideas. They are what make your streaks possible in the first place, so they better be good ones. But I digress.</p>
<p>Just make sure you have fun and get over the first two weeks, those are the hardest. So with this in mind, on to the next battle! 200 days of Github, hopefully see you then.</p>
