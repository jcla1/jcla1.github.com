<p>Last month I was in Brussels with <a href="http://pipetree.com/qmacro">@qmacro</a> for <a href="https://fosdem.org/2014/">FOSDEM 2014</a>. At the time I was working on a little side project: <a href="https://github.com/jcla1/gisp">Gisp</a>, a Lisp to Go compiler. On the Sunday I decided it was time to present Gisp to the world, so I gave a lightning talk in the Go room.</p>
<p>In the talk I showcase the generated Go code Gisp produces for some simple Lisp programs, as well as the Go AST generating REPL that's included in Gisp. Also great thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/enneff">Andrew Gerrand</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/bradfitz">Brad Fitzpatrick</a> for organizing the Go dev-room at this year's FOSDEM!</p>
<p>I'm up first in the video, but the other talks are definitely worth while too.
