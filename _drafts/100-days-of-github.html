title: 100 days of Github
abstract: Endeavour into the Github contributions streak trend.
---

<p>In recent times <a href="https://ryanseys.com/blog/177-days-of-github/">there's been</a> <a href="http://natashatherobot.com/streak-github-mistakes/">a trend</a> <a href="http://danwin.com/2013/12/github-activity-for-2013-1500-commits-52-day-streak/">coming up</a>, of having <i>long</i> commit streaks on Github. Be it for fun, <a href="http://dontbreakthechain.com/">motivational purposes</a> or just out of boredom. In any case, I decided to also hop onto the train and try it for myself. In the following, I'd like to share my experience with you as to what helped survive my first 100 days of Github.</p>

<h2>An open source project</h2>
<p>Github is a platform for open source projects, so it will obviously be a great help to either contribute regularly or even maintain an open source project, or multiple. This has saved me a few times during my streak, because as Ryan Seys already noticed in his <a href="https://ryanseys.com/blog/177-days-of-github/">blog post</a> about commit streaks:</p>
<blockquote>Pull requests count for 1 contribution when you make them and another contribution if they are merged. If they donâ€™t get merged, sorry, no second contribution.</blockquote>
<p>So no need directly send a PR when you push, you can take your time knowing that your PR will also count as a contribution. Plus if you get promoted to contributer status in a repository, your merge commits (of other PRs) also count as contributions.</p>
<p>In my case, I contributed to a <a href="https://github.com/kennyledet/Algorithm-Implementations">repository of algorithms</a>, which you should go check it out (pun definitely intended) and contribute to it. This repository also has the nice effect that there's a near infinite amount of algorithms to implement (combined with a vast amount of different languages), so you won't run out of things to implement.</a>
<!--
Contribute to (and ideally maintain) an OS project
Helps a lot, because you can have PRs as contributions
Bring in algorithms repo as an example
-->

<h2>A blog</h2>
<!--
Good if you can't think of a worthy `code` contribution
If you haven't got one already, it may be the ideal time
for setting up a new one
Also: Drafting posts helps too, and as a bonus your posts
      are (mostly) better if you draft and have time to think about the content

<h2>Programmer's challenges</h2>

<h2>Ideas, Ideas, Ideas!</h2>

- Give some additional tips on how to reach a long commit streak
- Picture of own commit streak (let's see how far this'll go)
