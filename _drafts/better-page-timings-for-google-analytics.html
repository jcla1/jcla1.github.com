abstract: Experiment to find a better way to track pageview times with Google Analytics.

- Google Analytics is nice, but lacks good measure of page view time,
  if only one page is visited, like on a blog
- 1st attempt:
    - When user enters page, send pageview and the send events every 10s
    - Pageview times went up
    - Bouncerate went down
    - But can we optimize?
- 2nd attempt:
    - Work with visibility of page to find when to send the
      pageview event
    - Should deliver more acurate measure of when page is actually
      visited
    - Integrate prerender thing from HTML5Rocks
- Final thoughts:
    - Maybe just send an event onunload of page, maybe check if
      user if navigating away from site?
    - Link to stackoverflow question, no answer so far
