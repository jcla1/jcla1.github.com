title: Improving Go cookie handling
abstract:
---

- Go's cookiejar is great, because it's built-in. It just works!
- Though it doesn't accept all cookies, that are not RFC compliant,
  especially annoying when talking to a 3rd-party server,
  whose cookies you can't control
- Present workaround for storing cookies in extra jar,
  and also snippet for loading them back in
- Include link to Go issue tracker: https://code.google.com/p/go/issues/detail?id=7243
