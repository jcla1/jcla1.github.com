- Recently: trend towards having long commit streaks on Github
- What you need:
    - Contribute to (and ideally maintain) an OS project
      Helps a lot, because you can have PRs as contributions
      Bring in algorithms repo as an example
    - A blog
      Good if you can't think of a worthy `code` contribution
      If you haven't got one already, it may be the ideal time
      for setting up a new one
      Also: Drafting posts helps too, and as a bonus your posts
            are (mostly) better if you draft and have time to think about the content
